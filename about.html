            <h3>About me</h3>
            <img class="CIO" src="/images/IMG_5690.PNG">
        <p class="bio2">I was born in Plattsburgh, New York, July 4th 1993.  I was roughly 11 miles shy of being Canadian.  Long story short I ended up in Louisiana, which my mother and her side of the family is from here as well.  My father was from Vermont but met my mother in New York through both being in the military.  He actually lives in New Mexico now too.  My family is spread out through out the U.S. but it makes for a good excuses to get away to a few different places.  I’ve been living in Louisiana for 15 years and more specifically, New Orleans, for almost 10 years.  It's a love hate relationship but it definitely made me the person I am today.  I started playing music in bands back in high school and haven't really stopped since.  It’s a huge part of my identity.  Growing up really into punk, hardcore and metal, at a young age I started going to see bands perform and instantly fell in love.  The scene used to be something really special around here.  I have more friends that are like family because of that scene too.  

        </p>
        <p class="bio2">I also grew up in what I personally like to call the MySpace era.  So my love for HTML started there.  We used to stay up late with friends hanging out on our laptops making our MySpace as cool as possible.  At least cool in our eyes.  Also my love for music grew exponentially through using that as well.  We used to find out about so much underground music there.  Anyway the love was real and we were watching the world of tech change right under our noses.  Being a musician and figuring out the way to promote on social media and present the bands as a whole was always just really fun.  I feel like through that it kept me up to speed with the ever changing world of the Internet and social media.</p>

        <p class="bio2">Thanks for reading!  This is just a very brief and hopefully not to vague, short story, of my life!  Always excited to see where the future will take me and I’m excited to put in all the work to achieve it! </p>
